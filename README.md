# VRA_PROJECTS

This repository contains two projects developed as part of the course **VRA: Virtual Reality and Its Applications**. The repository is structured with two main folders: `OpenGL` and `ThreeJS`, each containing one complete project.

##  OpenGL Project ‚Äì *Solar System Simulation*

**Location:** `OpenGL/`

This is a solar system simulation built using C++ and OpenGL. The project visualizes planets orbiting and rotating around the sun. It also includes lighting effects and an animated comet event where Halley‚Äôs Comet collides with Earth.

### Features:
- Rotating and orbiting planets
- Lighting and shading
- Realistic angular speeds and distances
- Optional comet animation and Earth impact effect

### Technologies:
- C++
- OpenGL
- GLUT

### How to Run:
1. Open the project in Code::Blocks or Visual Studio.
2. Make sure OpenGL and GLUT libraries are set up.
3. Compile and run the main source file.

##  Three.js Project ‚Äì *Escape to Survive*

**Location:** `ThreeJS/`

This is a first-person 3D survival game built using Three.js. The player explores a stormy island, collects necessary items, and escapes on a boat when all conditions are met.

### Features:
- First-person controls (WASD + mouse)
- Realistic water, sky, and lighting
- Interactive objects and escape logic


### Technologies:
- JavaScript
- Three.js
- WebGL
- GLTF models

### How to Run:
1. run `npm install` to install any missing dependencies.
2. `npm run dev` to run the project
3. Controls:
   - `W A S D` to move
   - `Mouse` to look around
   - `Q, E ` to interact with objects
   - `F` to build boat at the end
   - `spacebar + J ` to hop on to the boat and escape the island
